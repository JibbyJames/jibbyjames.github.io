      <description>&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, with over 2 billion active users.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I made the decision to log every film I watched so that I could one day analyse this data in some way.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Site speed metrics can be obtained using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse&#34;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; auditing tool, which can be run within Google Chrome. Metrics like this have started to become used in SEO ranking, so naturally if efforts are being made to improve site speed, it makes sense to measure and report on it. When tasked with creating a dashboard displaying Lighthouse metrics over time, what better way to display the current score for each metric than in the very same gauges Lighthouse itself uses in its reports?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
